# HakeJS
> Unfinished by Dominic Ming

## What is this
HakeJS is a modern web framework with simple data bind. It's based on components
to build.

It's a project for me to touch what inside framework do, and learn web front-end better.

## What's special

- You can use Hake lang to write template.

    It look like this;
    ```
    (div(a{href="sss"} {{somedata}}www))
    ```
- Nearly every function can be use.

    You can directly use part of the function as a tool instead of use whole Hake.

- Shadow DOM

    I will write Shadow DOM Mode for who want use it in new browser.

- Virtual DOM

    It will come back, only wait for some time.

## About abolished

- It's a mistake to write that code, "I don't know her."
